[["apl-mode.png"]]


This code gives a APL interface to Emacs for april - a common lisp embedded APL language
See: https://github.com/phantomics/april
The interface inspired by https://tryapl.org as I was not that happy with the gnu-apl-mode
interface. The unicode characters of APL are entered with two key strokes and a tab - called a cord.
They are a mnemonic where the keys when combined look simular to what the unicode chacter looks like.
I find that makes them more intuitive and easy to remember.
Examples:
  aa<tab> → ⍺,  xx<tab> → ×, 0~<tab> → ⍬, <><tab> → ◊
There is a optional header which displays the APL characters. When you click them they are entered in the code
at the cursor position. When you hover over them a popup is displayed. I contains: the operator, the monadic and
dyadic meaning and the key cord. You can enter the key cord from the keyboard if you don't want to mouse-click the
header character.
